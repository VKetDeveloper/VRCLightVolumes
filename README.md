VRC Light Volumes is an optimized nextgen voxel based light probes replacement and parametric lighting solution for VRChat.

**[Installation process described here](#Installation-through-VRChat-Creator-Companion)**

This is a free open-source asset, so if you like it, I would be very happy if you **[Support me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/red_sim/ "Support me on Patreon")**.
There is a bunch of other cool assets you will get there!

## Use Cases
- Baked partial avatars and dynamic props lighting
- Baked seamless lightmaps for small static objects
- Fast and optimized Point, Spot and Area lights
- Fast image and cubemap projectors
- Any volumetric light effects

## Main Features
- Baked per-pixel voxel based lighting
- Affects avatars and dynamic props (shader integration required)
- Fast and performant
- Can change color in runtime
- Up to 32 light volumes visible at the same time
- Up to 128 optimized Point, Spot or Area light sources visible at the same time
- Baked shadows for realtime Point, Spot or Area lights
- Works with dynamic batching, which potentially increases performance
- Works with Bakery or Unity Progressive lightmapper
- Works with AudioLink and TV screens
- Very easy and fast to setup
- It just looks beautiful!

## Attribution

It would be greatly appreciated if you place in your VRChat world an attribution prefab provided with this package.

Look for it here: `Packages/VRC Light Volumes/Attribution/`

This will help users know they can use avatars with VRC Light Volumes compatible shaders and also learn more about the system.

<p align="center"> <img src="./Packages/red.sim.lightvolumes/Attribution/LV_Logo_A.png#gh-light-mode-only" alt="VRC Light Volumes Logo" width="400" /></p>

Alternatively, you can include a message like this:

```
This world supports VRC Light Volumes. Use avatar shaders with VRC Light Volumes support for an enhanced visual experience.
VRC Light Volumes by RED_SIM â€” GitHub: https://github.com/REDSIM/VRCLightVolumes/
```

You're not required to include this prefab or a message - it's entirely optional. But if you do, it helps spread the word and supports the growth of this asset in the VRChat community.
