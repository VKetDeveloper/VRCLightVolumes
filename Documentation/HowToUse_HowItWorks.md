## How Do Light Volumes Work?

This section is mainly for developers and curious users who want to understand how the Light Volumes system works under the hood. It's not necessary to read or learn this to use the system. Let's first look at how regular Light Volumes work!

## Spherical Harmonics

Spherical Harmonics (SH) are used to represent how light affects a point in space. In the case of Light Volumes, **L1 Spherical Harmonics** are used - a very rough approximation, but efficient to compute and sufficient for real-time rendering.

L1 Spherical Harmonics consist of:

- **L0** - Ambient color. Represents the average light color at a point in space. It's just a flat color with no directional information.
- **L1 Red** - Directional information for **Red** light. A vector representing the average direction the red light is coming from. The longer the vector, the brighter the light.
- **L1 Green** - Directional information for **Green** light.
- **L1 Blue** - Directional information for **Blue** light.

This is a simplified explanation of L1 SH, but much easier to understand than many technical descriptions you'll find elsewhere.

## Light Data

Light Volumes are 3D textures made of voxels - essentially 3D pixels, like blocks in Minecraft. Each voxel stores RGBA values, just like pixels in a 2D texture. However, in this system, each channel stores numerical data rather than actual color. Here's what a Light Volume voxel contains:

The arrows illustrate the L1 vectors for the Red, Green, and Blue channels - they represent the average incoming light direction per color. It's important to remember that SH L1 only stores the average light direction, so you can't tell how many actual lights are contributing to a point.

Each Light Volume holds light data for a 3D grid of world-space positions. The higher the resolution, the more accurately it represents lighting - just like with regular 2D textures.

## Light Data Storage

A regular 3D texture supports only 4 channels per voxel (RGBA), but SH L1 needs 12 channels. Therefore, we can't store all the data in a single texture.

So, we split the data into **three** separate 3D textures, each containing part of the SH data. Since the data is numeric, each SH vector component can be stored across the RGBA channels of these textures.

For better performance in shaders, all these textures are combined into a single 3D texture atlas, laid out next to each other. Some padding is added around each texture "island" to prevent light leaking between them.

Additionally, if you have multiple Light Volumes in a scene, their data is also combined into this atlas. The final result is a large 3D texture atlas that stores multiple SH volumes.

## Light Volume Evaluation

The process of sampling the atlas and evaluating the light happens entirely in the shader. That's why a material must support Light Volumes by including the appropriate shader code.

Besides the SH data atlas, the system also stores **3D UV (UVW)** information, which converts world space coordinates into positions in the SH atlas. For each pixel, the shader calculates the world position, then samples the SH data using interpolated values from nearby voxels.

Once the shader retrieves the L0 and L1 data, it computes the final color using a simple formula:

```glsl
FinalColor = L0 + dot(L1, WorldNormal);
```

This is the fastest and simplest method of evaluating SH data. There are more advanced methods (e.g., Geomerics or ZH3), but they are more expensive.

## Point Light Volumes

Point Light Volumes also use SH L1 to describe lighting - but they don't store it in voxels. Instead, it's computed analytically in real time using a mathematical formula.

Each light type has its own way of computing SH coefficients. For point lights, we use an **inverse square attenuation** formula, which is much closer to real-life lighting behavior. It also considers the **physical size** of the light source.

The attenuation formula is:

```math
Attenuation = \frac{1}{\text{LightSize}^2 + \text{DistanceToLight}^2}
```

The final color is calculated like this:

```math
FinalColor = \text{Attenuation} \times \text{Color} \times \text{Intensity} \times \text{LightSize}^2
```

In this formula, the light's **intensity** is multiplied by the square of its size, making it behave more like light emitted per unit surface area, rather than total emitted energy.

To cull lights at a distance, we use a distance-based mask:

```math
Mask = \text{Saturate}\left(1 - \frac{\text{DistanceToLight}^2}{\text{CutoffDistance}^2}\right)
```

The `Saturate()` function clamps the value between 0 and 1. The final light color is multiplied by this squared mask.
